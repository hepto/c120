# We are running get_iplayer in Docker which sends a SIGTERM when a container is stopped.
# Unforutnatley, the pvr_lock is not removed on a SIGTERM so fails to start up again.
# This is then fatal on a reboot as the scheduler will not start again.
#Â Fix is to catch the SIGTERM and convert it into a SIGINT which will remove the lock.
